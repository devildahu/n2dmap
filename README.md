# n2dmap

Crates to handle conversion from **normal** map (n) **to depth** map (d)
in bevy and outside of bevy.

This crate is very much just a wrapper around the `fft2d` [normal integration
example][fft2d-n2d], with additional improvements, mostly to make it work
nicely with bevy.

### [`n2dmap`]

A small wrapper around the [`fft2d`] crate to convert normal maps in depth maps.

It is directly derived from the `fft2d` [example][fft2d-n2d].

It is a library that exposes a single function taking an `Image` in the format
of a normal map (a three channel image with 8 bit color components in linear
color space) and returning a depth map, with values between 0 and 1, where
0 is the closest to the surface, while 1 is the deepest.

### [`n2dmap_cli`]

It's just an executable binary version of `n2dmap`.
See `n2dmap --help` for usage details.

### [`bevy_mod_n2dmap`]

A plugin for [bevy], exposes the `N2dmapMaterialExtension` trait, which adds the
`generate_depth_map()` method to bevy's `StandardMaterial`.
